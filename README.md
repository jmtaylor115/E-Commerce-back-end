# E-Commerce-back-end
    In this project, I linked the back end of an e-commerce site. I started by creating the four databse models (Category, Tag, Product, and ProductTag). Then, I then proceeded to set up associations between the four databases (Product => Category, many Procucts to Category, Product => many Tag, Tag => many Product). Afterwards, I updated my roots the four models so that they had routes for finding one or all Models, updating modes, deleting models, and creating models.
